# Machine-Learning-based-Air-Pollution-Prediction
Air quality is a major concern in many nations throughout the world due to the negative
impact of air pollution on human health and the environment. • Machine learning techniques can be used to predict air pollution levels
• Air quality models can also be used to predict future pollutant concentrations from multiple 
sources after the implementation of a new regulatory program, in order to estimate the 
effectiveness of the program in reducing harmful exposures to humans and the environment. • Machine learning techniques can be used to predict air pollution levels
• Comparing the performances of different machine learning methods, random forest 
regression had the highest accuracy and the lowest RMSE in predicting air pollution levels
